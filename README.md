# Code Folding for LLM-Assisted Editing

## Overview

This program is designed to optimize the process of making code changes suggested by a Large Language Model (LLM). It addresses the challenge of efficiently handling large codebases when working with LLMs, which often have input size limitations and can be slower with larger inputs.

## Functionality

The program takes two inputs:
1. The original source code file
2. The suggested changes from an LLM in natural language format

It then produces a condensed version of the original file, keeping only the parts relevant to the suggested changes. This condensed version can be sent to another LLM for actual editing, resulting in faster processing and reduced latency.

## How It Works

1. **Parse the File**: The program identifies foldable regions in the code, such as function bodies.

2. **Fuzzy Matching**: It uses fuzzy matching to identify function names mentioned in the LLM's suggestions.

3. **String Similarity**: The program compares each line of the LLM's output to the lines in the original file, finding the best matches.

4. **Filter Generic Matches**: Common, generic code patterns (e.g., `fn new() -> Self`) are filtered out to avoid false positives.

5. **Selective Inclusion**: Based on the matches found, the program decides which parts of the code to keep. It includes entire foldable regions (never partial) that are relevant to the suggested changes.

6. **Generate Condensed File**: The program creates a new version of the file with irrelevant parts collapsed or removed.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Input Size**: By sending only the relevant parts of the code to the editing LLM, we can work with larger codebases more efficiently.
- **Faster Editing**: Smaller inputs lead to faster processing times for the LLM.
- **Focused Changes**: By providing only the relevant code sections, we reduce the chance of unintended modifications in unrelated parts of the code.
